# Activity details components

This document describes how you can use different activity details components.

There are following components for details: 
* `OrderDetails` — component to render details for any kind of order (open or filled).
* `WalletActivityDetails` — details for deposits and withdraws.
* `AccountTransactionDetails` — component to render generic account transaction item (aka Recent Activity). it doesn't have activity specific information like order status, etc.
* `MarginPositionDetails` — component to render details for the  margin positions.

You can create separate screens for each type of details or you can have a single screen for all these details and render them depending on `type` parameter passed from a [List component](?path=/docs/activity-list-how-to-use--docs) (`order`, `wallet`, `accountPosition`).

Each of the components listed above is responsible to tranform `ActivityItem` (see [List](?path=/docs/activity-list-how-to-use--docs) for more details) into the props of the [`ActivityDetailsCard`](?path=/docs/activity-details-activitydetailscard--docs) component.

You can find more details on each of these components:
