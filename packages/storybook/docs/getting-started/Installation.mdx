# Installation

## Authenticate in the private NPM Registry

You must authenticate to the Package Registry to install the APEX UI kit from a private registry.

To authenticate with `npm` run this commmand in the root directory of your project:

```bash
npm config set -- //git.lab.apdev.net/api/v4/groups/apex/-/packages/npm/:_authToken=${APEX_NPM_TOKEN}
```

This will create a `.npmrc` file in the project root.

## Install package

Now you can install APEX UI Kit in your project.

```bash
npm install @apex-rn/library
```

You also need to install peer dependencies:

```bash
npm install @react-navigation/native @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux react-hook-form
```

## Integration

Now you can configure the UI kit following this documentation — [Configuration](?path=/docs/getting-started-configuration--docs).
